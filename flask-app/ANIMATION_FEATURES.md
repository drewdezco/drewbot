# Real-Time Code Change Animation Features

## Overview
Your Flask app now includes smooth, real-time code change animations that visualize AI-assisted code modifications as they happen!

## Features

### üé¨ Animation Modes
The app includes 4 animation speeds accessible via the dropdown in the top-right corner:

1. **üêå Slow** - Character delay: 8ms, Line delay: 50ms
   - Perfect for demonstrations and presentations
   - Shows every character being typed in slow motion

2. **‚ö° Medium** (Default) - Character delay: 3ms, Line delay: 20ms
   - Balanced speed for regular use
   - Fast enough to be efficient, slow enough to see changes

3. **üöÄ Fast** - Character delay: 1ms, Line delay: 5ms
   - Quick animation for experienced users
   - Minimal delay while still showing the typing effect

4. **‚è© Instant** - No delay
   - Disables animation for immediate code updates
   - Best for power users who want maximum speed

### ‚ú® Animation Effects

#### Line Highlighting
- Changed lines are highlighted with a yellow glow before animation starts
- Pulses to draw attention to modifications
- Automatically clears after animation completes

#### Character-by-Character Typing
- Modified lines animate character by character
- Unchanged lines appear instantly for efficiency
- Cursor follows the typing animation in real-time

#### Smart Diff Detection
- Automatically detects which lines changed
- Only animates modified/added/removed lines
- Preserves unchanged code for performance

## How It Works

### Technical Implementation

1. **Diff Computation**
   ```javascript
   computeDiff(oldCode, newCode)
   ```
   - Compares old and new code line by line
   - Identifies added, removed, and modified lines
   - Returns array of changes with line numbers

2. **Monaco Editor Decorations**
   ```javascript
   editor.deltaDecorations([], decorations)
   ```
   - Adds visual highlights to changed lines
   - Uses custom CSS classes for styling
   - Clears decorations after animation

3. **Animated Code Insertion**
   ```javascript
   await animateCodeChange(newCode)
   ```
   - Asynchronously types out new code
   - Respects animation speed settings
   - Moves cursor and scrolls viewport automatically

## Usage

### For Users
1. Select your preferred animation speed from the dropdown
2. Ask Drew Bot to modify your code
3. Watch as changes animate in real-time!
4. Use **Undo** button to revert if needed

### For Developers
The animation system is modular and can be customized:

```javascript
// Modify speed settings
const speedSettings = {
  slow: { charDelay: 8, lineDelay: 50 },
  medium: { charDelay: 3, lineDelay: 20 },
  fast: { charDelay: 1, lineDelay: 5 },
  instant: { charDelay: 0, lineDelay: 0 }
};

// Toggle animation on/off programmatically
animationEnabled = true/false;

// Change speed programmatically
animationSpeed = 'slow'|'medium'|'fast'|'instant';
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback** - See exactly what's changing
- **Comprehension** - Easier to follow code modifications
- **Engagement** - More engaging than instant replacement
- **Trust** - Transparency in AI-assisted coding

### Development
- **Debugging** - Spot unintended changes immediately
- **Learning** - Educational for understanding modifications
- **Presentation** - Great for demos and teaching
- **Flexibility** - Multiple speed options for different needs

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- üé® Different highlight colors for add/remove/modify
- üìä Show diff summary before animation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause/resume animation controls
- üîÑ Animation replay feature
- üéØ Focus mode (highlights only changed sections)
- üìù Side-by-side diff view option

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: ‚úÖ Full support
- Firefox: ‚úÖ Full support
- Safari: ‚úÖ Full support
- Monaco Editor required (loaded via CDN)

## Performance
- Efficient for files up to ~1000 lines
- Only animates changed lines
- Instant mode available for large files
- Smooth 60 FPS animation on modern hardware
