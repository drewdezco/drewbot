# Real-Time Code Animation Setup - Complete Guide

## 🎉 What's Been Added

Your Flask app now has **real-time animated code changes**! When Drew Bot modifies your code, you'll see:

1. **Highlighted Changed Lines** - Yellow glow on modified lines
2. **Character-by-Character Typing** - Watch code appear as if typed
3. **Smart Speed Control** - 4 speed settings (Slow, Medium, Fast, Instant)
4. **Smooth Animations** - Professional, polished visual effects

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Your Flask App
```bash
cd flask-app
python app.py
```

### 2. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 3. Try It Out!

**Step-by-step demo:**

1. **Load or write some code** in the Monaco editor (left panel)
   ```python
   def hello():
       print("Hello World")
   ```

2. **Select animation speed** from the dropdown (top-right)
   - Try **"⚡ Medium"** first (default)

3. **Ask Drew Bot to modify it**:
   - Example: *"Add a parameter called 'name' and personalize the greeting"*
   - Example: *"Add error handling to this function"*
   - Example: *"Refactor this into a class"*

4. **Watch the magic happen!**
   - Lines will highlight in yellow
   - Code will type out character by character
   - Changed sections animate smoothly

## 🎛️ Animation Controls

### Speed Dropdown (Top-Right Corner)

| Speed | Icon | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Slow** | 🐌 | Presentations, demos, teaching |
| **Medium** | ⚡ | Regular coding (default) |
| **Fast** | 🚀 | Experienced users, quick edits |
| **Instant** | ⏩ | Large files, no animation needed |

The animation speed persists throughout your session and can be changed anytime.

## 🎨 Visual Effects Explained

### Before Animation
```
Changed lines highlight in yellow with a pulse effect (200ms)
```

### During Animation
```
- Modified lines: Type character-by-character
- Unchanged lines: Appear instantly (performance optimization)
- Cursor: Follows typing in real-time
- Viewport: Auto-scrolls to show current changes
```

### After Animation
```
Highlights fade out, leaving clean code
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### What Changed in Your Files

#### `templates/index.html`
- ✅ Added `animateCodeChange()` function
- ✅ Added `computeDiff()` for change detection
- ✅ Added animation speed settings
- ✅ Added dropdown control and event listener
- ✅ Modified code update flow to use animation

#### `static/style.css`
- ✅ Added `.line-changing` class for highlights
- ✅ Added `.line-changing-glyph` for line indicators
- ✅ Added `pulse-highlight` animation
- ✅ Added dropdown styling to match UI
- ✅ Added cursor blink animation

### Animation Algorithm

```javascript
1. Get old code from editor
2. Compare with new code (line-by-line diff)
3. Highlight changed lines with Monaco decorations
4. Clear editor
5. For each line:
   - If changed: Type character-by-character
   - If unchanged: Insert instantly
6. Clear decorations
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Only changed lines animate
- Instant mode for zero delay
- Efficient string comparisons
- Monaco Editor's native APIs for smooth rendering

## 🎬 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Addition
**Before:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Ask Drew Bot:** *"Add type hints"*

**Watch:** Only the function signature animates with type hints being added!

---

### Scenario 2: Refactoring
**Before:**
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```

**Ask Drew Bot:** *"Convert this to a function"*

**Watch:** The entire structure changes with smooth animation!

---

### Scenario 3: Bug Fix
**Before:**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```

**Ask Drew Bot:** *"Add error handling for division by zero"*

**Watch:** See try-except blocks type out line by line!

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Change Animation Speeds

Edit these values in `templates/index.html`:

```javascript
const speedSettings = {
  slow: { charDelay: 8, lineDelay: 50 },      // ← Increase for slower
  medium: { charDelay: 3, lineDelay: 20 },    // ← Default sweet spot
  fast: { charDelay: 1, lineDelay: 5 },       // ← Decrease for faster
  instant: { charDelay: 0, lineDelay: 0 }     // ← No animation
};
```

### Change Highlight Colors

Edit in `static/style.css`:

```css
.line-changing {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.15) !important;  /* Yellow */
  /* Try: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.15) for green */
  /* Try: rgba(0, 150, 255, 0.15) for blue */
}
```

### Disable Animation by Default

In `templates/index.html`:

```javascript
let animationEnabled = false;  // Changed from true
let animationSpeed = 'instant'; // Changed from 'medium'
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Animation Not Working?
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure Monaco Editor loaded successfully
3. Try "Instant" mode, then switch back to test

### Animation Too Slow?
1. Select "🚀 Fast" or "⏩ Instant" from dropdown
2. Or customize speeds in code (see above)

### Lines Not Highlighting?
1. Check CSS is loading (`style.css`)
2. Inspect element to verify classes are applied
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Code Appears Instantly?
1. Verify animation speed isn't set to "Instant"
2. Check if file is very small (might finish too fast)
3. Try "Slow" mode to see effect clearly

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Presentations
- Use **🐌 Slow** mode
- Ask for one change at a time
- Let audience see the typing effect

### For Development
- Use **⚡ Medium** mode (default)
- Balance between speed and visibility
- Switch to Fast when making many changes

### For Large Files
- Use **⏩ Instant** mode
- Animation overhead increases with file size
- Save time on bulk operations

### For Learning
- Use **🐌 Slow** or **⚡ Medium**
- Watch changes carefully
- Use Undo button to compare
