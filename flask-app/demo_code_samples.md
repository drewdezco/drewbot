## Sample 1: Simple Function Enhancement

### Starting Code:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Add a name parameter and make it personalized"*
- *"Add a docstring"*
- *"Add type hints"*

### Expected Animation:
Watch the function signature change and new lines appear!

## Sample 2: Add Error Handling

### Starting Code:
```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

result = divide(10, 2)
print(result)
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Add error handling for division by zero"*
- *"Add input validation"*

### Expected Animation:
See try-except blocks animate in character by character!

## Sample 3: Refactor to Class

### Starting Code:
```python
user_name = "John"
user_age = 30
user_email = "john@example.com"

def display_info():
    print(f"Name: {user_name}")
    print(f"Age: {user_age}")
    print(f"Email: {user_email}")
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Convert this to a User class"*
- *"Refactor using a class with methods"*

### Expected Animation:
Major restructuring with smooth transitions!

    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item
    return total
```

### Ask Drew Bot:

### Expected Animation:
New lines appearing with highlighted changes!

---

## Sample 5: Optimize Code

### Starting Code:
```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Use Python's built-in max function"*
- *"Make it more Pythonic"*

### Expected Animation:
Watch simplification happen in real-time!

---

## Sample 6: Add Comments

### Starting Code:
```python
def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        if item > 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Add detailed comments explaining each step"*
- *"Add a comprehensive docstring"*

### Expected Animation:
Comments appearing line by line!

---

## Sample 7: API Endpoint (Flask)

### Starting Code:
```python
@app.route('/users')
def get_users():
    return {"users": []}
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Add POST method support"*
- *"Add pagination parameters"*
- *"Add error handling"*

### Expected Animation:
Watch Flask route expand with new features!

---

## Sample 8: Data Processing

### Starting Code:
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for num in data:
    sum += num
average = sum / len(data)
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Use list comprehensions"*
- *"Add statistics calculation (mean, median, mode)"*
- *"Handle empty data case"*

### Expected Animation:
See code transform into more efficient version!

---

## Sample 9: Configuration

### Starting Code:
```python
API_KEY = "abc123"
DEBUG = True
PORT = 5000
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Convert to a config class"*
- *"Add environment variable support"*
- *"Add validation"*

### Expected Animation:
Watch structure evolve from simple to sophisticated!

---

## Sample 10: Testing

### Starting Code:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))
```

### Ask Drew Bot:
- *"Add unit tests using pytest"*
- *"Add edge case tests"*

### Expected Animation:
Test functions appearing with smooth typing effect!

---

## Testing Different Animation Speeds

### Recommended Test Progression:

1. **Start with SLOW (üêå)**
   - Use Sample 1 or 2
   - Watch every character appear
   - Perfect for first-time viewing

2. **Switch to MEDIUM (‚ö°)**
   - Use Sample 3 or 4
   - Balanced speed
   - Daily usage sweet spot

3. **Try FAST (üöÄ)**
   - Use Sample 5 or 6
   - Quick but visible
   - For experienced users

4. **Compare with INSTANT (‚è©)**
   - Use any sample
   - See the difference!
   - For maximum speed

### üé¨ Best Samples for Demos:
- Sample 3 (Refactor to Class) - Shows major transformation
- Sample 2 (Error Handling) - Clear before/after
- Sample 9 (Configuration) - Professional example

### üéì Best for Learning:
- Sample 1 (Simple Enhancement) - Easy to follow
- Sample 6 (Add Comments) - Shows incremental changes
- Sample 5 (Optimization) - Learn best practices

### üöÄ Best for Speed Testing:

## What to Watch For

### During Animation:

‚úÖ **Yellow highlight** appears on lines that will change  
‚úÖ **Character-by-character typing** on modified lines  
‚úÖ **Unchanged lines** appear instantly (optimization)  
‚úÖ **Cursor movement** follows the typing  
‚úÖ **Auto-scrolling** keeps changes visible  
‚úÖ **Smooth transitions** between lines  

### After Animation:

‚úÖ Highlights fade away  
‚úÖ Code is properly formatted  
‚úÖ Syntax highlighting is correct  
‚úÖ Cursor at end of document  
‚úÖ Ready for next change

## Experiment Ideas

### Try Different Modifications:

**Same Code, Different Asks:**
```python
# Starting code
def process(data):
    return [x * 2 for x in data]
```

Ask Drew Bot different things:
1. "Add filtering for positive numbers only"
2. "Add error handling"
3. "Convert to a class method"
4. "Add type hints and docstring"
5. "Make it work with dictionaries"

Each will create different animations!

---

## Advanced Testing

### Chain Multiple Changes:
1. Start with Sample 1
2. Ask for modification (watch animation)
3. Immediately ask for another change
4. See consecutive animations!

### Test Undo:
1. Make a change (watch animation)
2. Click "‚Ü© Undo" button
3. Code reverts (instantly)
4. Make new change (watch new animation)

### Speed Switching:
1. Start animation in Slow mode
2. While animating, switch to Instant
3. See immediate effect!

## Create Your Own Samples

### Template:
```python
# Simple starting code
[Your code here]

# Ask Drew Bot to:
# 1. [First modification]
# 2. [Second modification]
# 3. [Third modification]

# Expected: [What should animate]
```

### Ideas for Custom Samples:
- Your actual project code
- Code from tutorials
- Algorithm implementations
- Design patterns
- Framework examples
